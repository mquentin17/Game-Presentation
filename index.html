					<h3>Uncharted 4</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>Set three years after the events of UNCHARTED 3: Drake’s Deception, Nathan Drake has presumably left the world of fortune hunting behind. However, it doesn’t take long for adventure to come calling when Drake’s brother, Sam, resurfaces seeking his help to save his own life and offering an adventure Drake can’t resist.                                                       

On the hunt for Captain Henry Avery’s long-lost treasure, Sam and Drake set off to find Libertalia, the pirate utopia deep in the forests of Madagascar. UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End takes players on a journey around the globe, through jungle isles, urban cities and snow-capped peaks on the search for Avery’s fortune.</p>

					<h3>Personal Review</h3>
					<p>This is undoubtedly one of the best games I have ever played. I had huge expectations for it because I had been waiting for it for 5 years. The story is fantastic, going into huge themes of family, betrayal, loyalty, and trust. The gameplay is great. Going from hand to hand combat to gun firing to swinging off a grappling onto a baddie has never felt as fluid. The climbing, although simple, puts on display the PS4's true power by showcasing the best graphics that I've ever seen. The numerous treasures located everywhere offer the game more replayability. Overall, I this is a system seller, and I recommend this to anyone who enjoys gaming.</p>

					<h3> The Division </h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>We live in a complex world. The more advanced it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes. We've created a house of cards: remove just one, and everything falls apart. Black Friday - a devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City, and one by one, basic services fail. In only days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos/ The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, these agnets are trained to operate independently in order to save society.When society falls, we rise. </p>

					</blockquote>

					<h3>Personal Review</h3>
					<p>This is a really fun and rewarding game. The story is just an excuse for people to travel inside a broken down New York, which looks extremely good in this game. Gameplay is fun, the player can carry 3 guns and has many different gadgets at his/her disposal. The best part of the game is the loot. Nothing feel better than the feeling one gets after getting brand new powerful gear after beating a near impossible boss. The collectibles are uncecessary, as they don't add much to the experience. The Dark Zone is a unique, fun, and exhilirating experience as you are pitted against other players and are given the choice between allying or fighting. This game is best enjoyed when played with others, as playing alone can make the game feel really repetitive. I would recomment this to people who enjoy looting games, being able to grind for power, and fun, cooperative multiplayer.</p>

					<h3> Overwatch</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE

						Soldiers. Scientists. Adventurers. Oddities. 

						In a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world: OVERWATCH.

						Overwatch ended the crisis, and helped maintain peace in the decades that followed, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. But, after many years, Overwatch’s influence waned, and it was eventually disbanded.

						Now, conflict is rising across the world again, and the call has gone out to heroes old and new. Are you with us?</p>

					<h3>Personal Review</h3>
						<p>This is an insanely fun game. The gameplay is fluid and fun, the maps are vibrant, and the characters display personality as well as relationships with other characters. Each character has its own backstory, and although the game lacks a multiplayer campaign, the little shorts are in such good quality that they seem right out of a Pixar movie. The competetive mode is enthralling, promoting the teamwork and coordination that is essential to winning. Anyone who enjoys a fun multiplayer should enjoy get this game. </p>

					<h3>Destiny</h3>
					<img src="http://www.goliath.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/destiny_rise_of_iron_11.jpg" alt="Destiny">
					<p> Release Date: September 9, 2016 Developer: Bungie </p>

					<h3> Destiny </h3>
					<p>Players take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding new content, missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of Destiny featured two small expansions, The Dark Below in December 2014 and House of Wolves in May 2015. A third, larger expansion, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. In December 2015, Destiny shifted to an event-based model, featuring more limited-time events. A new, large expansion called Rise of Iron was released in September 2016, beginning Year Three. Rise of Iron was only released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 clients subsequently stopped receiving updates.</p>
					<h3>Personal Review</h3>
					<p>Similar to The Division, this game doesn't focus much on the story, although lore and little clues in the world help establish it as a living and breathing one. The gameplay, although 30fps, is fun. The guns feel good, and the ultimate abilities set it apart from other shooters. There is a seamless blend from PVP to PVE where all of the gear that is acquired can be used anywhere. Raids are the peak of the endgame. They require an extremely coordinated team, but the rewards are well worth it. </p>

					<h3>Star Wars: Battlefront</h3>
					<p>Star Wars Battlefront is an action shooter video game developed by EA DICE, with additional work from Criterion Games, and published by Electronic Arts. The game, based on the Star Wars franchise, is the third major release in the Star Wars: Battlefront sub-series, and is considered a reboot to the previous games, instead of a sequel. The game was released worldwide in November 2015, and received mixed reviews from critics. Critics praised the game for its gameplay, visuals and high production values but was criticized for its lack of content on both single player and multiplayer modes. Despite this, it still shipped over 13 million copies.</p>
					<h3>Personal Review</h3>
					<p>This game's story is practically nonexistent. The modes just serve as a type of tutorial for the basics of the game. The survival mode however, is a fun and intense thrill ride that can be had with a friend sitting down on the couch beside you. The progression system, although slow, rewards the player with more gadgets to be used in battle. The graphics and sound design are amazing. As soon as you start the game, you feel like you are planted right in the movie, fighting the famous battles. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Battlefield or a fun, brainless shooter.</p>
